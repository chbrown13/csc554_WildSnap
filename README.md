For this project we developed WildSnap, a proof of concept for a mobile app that allows users to quickly identify wildlife and plants by taking pictures and interact with other users. Our design adheres to HCI design principles and provides a simple user interface. More details can be found in our final project report in paper/WildSnap_Report.pdf.
